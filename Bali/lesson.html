      <p><em>Made’s Holiday in Bali </br>
Made and his family went to Bali last weekend. They flew from Makassar on Friday and arrived in Bali at night. They stayed in a hotel near the beach. The hotel had a big swimming pool. Made was very happy.
</br></br>On Saturday morning, the weather was sunny. Made, his parents, and his little brother went to the beach. They played in the sand, swam in the sea, and drank fresh coconut water. Made tried surfing for the first time. He fell many times, but he laughed and had fun. His father took many pictures.
At night, they ate dinner at a seafood restaurant. Made liked the grilled shrimp and fish soup. After dinner, they walked around the art market and bought souvenirs like bracelets and T-shirts.
</br></br>On Sunday, Made and his father stayed at the hotel to rest. His mother went to the traditional market to buy fruits and spices. Made’s little brother went with her. He liked seeing all the colorful things in the market.
</br></br>Before going home, they visited Tanah Lot Temple and watched the sunset. It was very beautiful. Made felt happy because he had a fun holiday with his family.
